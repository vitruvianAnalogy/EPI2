/**
 * Time complexity
 * O(N*logN) for Collections.sort
 * Minheap operations like poll and offer take O(log N) time and they
 * happen inside an iteration that takes O(N) time, hence making that (N * log N) as well
 *
 * O(N) is the space complexity because
 * in worst case the minHeap will have all the meetings
 * since all the meetings will be overlapping
 *
 *
 * MinHeap's function is that it keeps the smallest end time possessing meeting at top
 * meaning the meeting that will finish first is at the top
 * hence that is our best chance to find a room
